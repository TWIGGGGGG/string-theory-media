2/Hi there and welcome to String Theory
5/Lesson 1, Anatomy of a guitar part 1
8/So in this video we are going to run
12/through the basic anaotmy of a guitar
14/This first lesson will apply to both
17/Electric and acoustic guitars, however
20/the next lesson in this series will deal
24/with more electric guitar specifics,
26/But for now, let's go through the anaotmy
28/of a guitar.
30/So, this guitar I have here is called a
33/Fender Stratocaster. This is the body of
35/the guitar, this big slab of wood here.
39/Guitars tend to be made out of all
42/sorts of woods.
44/This one is made out of maple.
47/This is the bridge of a guitar, which
51/Is where the strings, of which there 
54/are six, they go through the back of
58/the body, through the trem block, which
61/is this thing here. This is specific to
63/the Fender Stratocaster, other guitars
66/might not have this.
68/And also in the bridge, this is the
71/tremelo arm, sometimes known as the
73/whammy bar, and you can use this to alter
76/the pitch of your guitar, like this [strums]
84/So next, we have the pickups here,
86/we've got one, two and three, for a
89/Fender Stratocaster, again, not going to
91/go too much into how they work, that
93/will be for next lesson.
95/We also have volume controls and
98/tone controls here,
101/and we have a pickup selector
103/Again, they'll all be covered in depth
106/In the next lesson.
108/So this is the neck of the guitar,
111/and the fretboard, the fretboard is
114/on the front of the neck, and then
116/we also have the neck down the back here.
120/So, the fretboard, on most guitars there
124/are between 21 and 24 frets, what's
128/common is 22 frets on a guitar.
132/On acoustic guitars it may vary, it may
135/be fewer than this, or more.
138/There are six strings on an electric
142/guitar, and they are labeled from the
144/thinnest string down to the thickest.
148/So we have the first string, the second
150/string, the third string, the fourth
156/the fifth string and the sixth string.
160/And on a guitar, if we want to refer to
164/a note, for example an A, B or C,
168/we would say that for example an A was
171/played from the 7th fret 4th string.
177/Moving on up the neck, we have the
180/headstock here. Now, the headstock is 
190/where the strings finish on a guitar,
203/So the headstock is where the strings
206/are fixed onto the guitar, the other
209/end is the bridge here, and
211/these are called the machine heads,
214/these are how you tune your guitar,
216/this little black thing here is
218/actually a cavity for something
220/called a truss rod, which we will
223/talk about in another lesson.
228/So that's about it for the
231/Anatomy of a Guitar Part 1,
235/I hope you leant somethign useful
