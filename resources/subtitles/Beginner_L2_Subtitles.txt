14/Hi there, welcome to String Theory lesson 2,
19/Anatomy of a guitar part 2.
21/Now, for this lesson, we're going to be
24/focused on the anatomy of specifically
27/an electric guitar,
29/and that means talking about electronics.
34/Mainly this portion of the guitar.
37/Now,guitars make their noise using pickups,
41/these things here. These pickups, when you
44/play the strings, the strings vibrate, and
49/those vibrations are captured by the pickups
53/and they make your guitar make noise, like
56/this:
64/Now, on most electric guitars, you have
69/multiple pickups. On this, which is a Fender
72/Stratocaster, there are three pickups here.
74/These are called single coil pickups, and
78/You can get pickups called humbucking pickups
82/and you can get pickups called P90 pickups.
85/They all sound different, they all do
87/slightly different things, however, one thing
90/they all have in common is that 
94/they all make your guitar make noise.
108/Now, guitars will usually come with a
111/pickup selector, which is this. Now, what
115/a pickup selector does is it allows you
118/to change which pickup your guitar is
121/currently using. It allows you to do this
124/because, depending on the position of each
127/of these pickups, the sound changes.
129/That has to do with the tension in the
132/strings at the bridge. So, for example, if
135/we go to the bridge pickup position,
139/on my Fender Stratocaster here, that is
143/the pickup selector in the downwards
146/position, and it sounds quite brittle
151/like this: 
153/[brittle guitar]
156/Now if I go to the neck pickup position,
159/which is right here, you'll hear that
161/it sounds a lot warmer and quite nice:
164/[warm and quite nice guitar]
176/And we can go to the middle position
179/for a different sound:
182/[different sounding guitar]
185/And we can try either the 4th or 2nd
188/positions, which are actually a
191/combination of these two pickups or
193/these two pickups:
196/[combined-sounding guitar]
213/Now, these knobs on your guitar,
216/on a Fender Stratocaster, they do
219/different things if you have a
221/different guitar, for example a
225/Les Paul style or even a telecaster
230/you might only have two knobs or
233/maybe youu only have one knob.
236/It's different all sorts of guitars,
240/but what you usually find is you have
244/a volume control and a tone control.
248/Now, the volume control is fairly self-
251/-explainatory. All the way off, and you
253/Can't hear any noise at all [quiet guitar]
257/And then I can roll it in, [louder guitar]
263/And take it away again. [quieter guitar]
279/Now, a tone control alters the way your
283/guitar sounds, it alters what's called
286/the 'timbre' of your guitar. Now, with
290/the tone control all the way up, the
293/tone control basically doesn't do anything
296/All the frequencies in your guitar tone
299/are there. [tonal guitar noises]
304/However, as I start to turn the tone 
307/control down, you should hear all the
309/bright harshness of that bridge pickup
312/start to fade away:
316/[progressively less harsh guitar noises]
324/And all the way off:
327/[very unharsh guitar]
335/And all the way back in again:
337/[very harsh guitar]
343/So, that about concludes Anatomy of a
348/guitar part 2, lesson 2 for beginner
351/String Theory, hope you learnt something
353/useful
